## PROMPT

> **Objectives:**
>
> - Engineer features, perform logistic regressions, and predict class probabilities.
> - Write up an executive summary that outlines your findings and the methods used.

In this project, you will perform a logistic regression on the admissions data we've been working with in projects 1 and 2.  You will also summarize and present your entire analysis.  Your goal is to complete your ongoing Jupyter Notebook, combining prior deliverables with an appendix and executive summary.  This will be a final overview of your analysis that incorporates past feedback and demonstrates your approach.

## DELIVERABLES

### Jupyter Notebook with Machine Learning Modeling

- **Requirements:**
  - Create one-hot encoding using binary variables.
  - Calculate odds ratios by hand.
  - Complete a logistic regression using `statsmodels` and interpret your findings.
  - Calculate predicted probabilities.
  - Do a similar analysis using `sklearn`.

### Updated Jupyter Notebook with Executive Summary

- **Requirements:**
  - Articulation of "Specific aim" and datasets.
  - Outlined methods and models.
  - Risks and assumptions.
  - Goals and criteria for success.
  - Exploratory data analysis overview with visualizations and statistical analysis.
  - Writeup on the interpretation of findings including an executive summary with conclusions and next steps.

## RESOURCES

### Dataset

The dataset is available [here](../dataset).

### Starter code

Review the questions in the [starter code notebook](./notebooks/unit-project-3-starter-code.ipynb) provided.

### Suggestions for Getting Started

- Review logistic regression, odds ratios and probabilities from prior lessons.
- **Read the documenation for `statsmodels` and `sklearn`.**  Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow; learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a data scientist.
- Review your previous work and any prior intructor feedback.
- Look up sample executive summaries online.
